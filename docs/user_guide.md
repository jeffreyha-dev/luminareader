## Troubleshooting

### Q: Why aren't my books saving?
**A:** LuminaReader uses your browser's storage. If you clear your browser cache/cookies, you might lose your library data. We recommend keeping backups of your original files.

### Q: Why is my PDF blurry?
**A:** Large PDFs may take a moment to render at full resolution. If it persists, try zooming in slightly to force a re-render.
